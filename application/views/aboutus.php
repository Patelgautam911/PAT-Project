                     A-Champs uses sports science, technology and the power of play to improve human performance. <strong>We call this human centred training</strong>. For decades we've been trained to think that grit, determination and mindlessly running endless track is the way to get fitter, faster and stronger. For most, this means putting their bodies through the boring motions of exercise, without any real results. Truth is, our bodies perform better when we're having fun. That when we inject unpredictable play into how we train, we perform better. That's why at the heart of our business are two words: <strong>PLAY UP</strong>. We know that by adding the power of unpredictability and fun to how we train, people perform better, for longer. That's why some of the world’s most elite sporting clubs use A-Champs to improve their performance. A-Champs is a digital fitness ecosystem consisting of training hardware and content for every level of fitness, whether you’re training to chase the kids around the park or for the Champions League. At the heart of this ecosystem is the A-ROX Pro, a reactive light training system used by 22,000 professional coaches and trainers globally.
